# This WebApp is a Learning Experience

overall UI is decent the front end is buggy(trying to make it ok ) as i am backend dev  

Following are point to note:

- it is a project based on Django and react combined using REST like API
	> API works fine

- Current Hot bugs are after faculty login navbar dont reload
	> it does for every other pages(as much i have seen)
